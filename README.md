This project delivers a responsive and visually striking calculator with three distinct themes and advanced scientific functions, including full memory management and keyboard support.

üöÄ Key Features
Glassmorphism Design: A modern, frosted glass look that is responsive and clean.

Themeable Interface: Toggle between Default (Purple/Blue Gradient), Dark Gradient, and Neon themes.

Advanced Math Functions: Includes Square Root, Power, Factorial, Reciprocal and Pi.

Full Memory Management: Dedicated buttons for adding, subtracting, recalling, and clearing values from memory.

Keyboard Support: Use your physical keyboard for lightning-fast calculations.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Calculator
1. Basic Operations
You can input numbers and basic arithmetic operators (+, ‚àí, √ó, √∑) by clicking the buttons or using your keyboard.

**Action  

Clear Display || Button (C) ||  Keyboard key (Esc or C) 
Backspace	    || Button (‚Üê) ||  Keyboard key (Backspace)                                 
Calculate	    || Button (=) ||  Keyboard key (Enter or =)
Decimal       || Button (.) || 	Keyboard key (.)          
Toggle Sign   || Button (¬±) ||	Keyboard key (T or t)            

2. Advanced Functions (Scientific Mode)
These functions operate directly on the number currently displayed in the output area.
                          
Square Root	  ||     Keyboard Key	 (R or r)      ||    Description  Calculates the square root of the displayed number.

Percentage	  ||     Keyboard Key	 (P or p)	     ||    Description Converts the displayed number to a percentage (divides by 100).

Power	        ||     Keyboard Key  (S or s)      ||    Description Calculates the square of the displayed number.

Factorial	    ||     Keyboard Key	 (F or f)	     ||    Description Calculates the factorial of the displayed integer (n!).

Reciprocal	  ||     Keyboard Key	 (I or i)      ||    DescriptionCalculates the inverse of the displayed number (1√∑x).

Pi	          ||     Keyboard Key		(None)       ||    DescriptionAppends the value of Pi (‚âà3.14159...) to the expression.

3. Understanding and Using Memory Functions üß†
The Memory functions allow you to store and manipulate a single running total (Memory Value) without affecting your current calculation. A small 'M' indicator will appear at the top-right of the screen when a non-zero value is stored in memory.


MC	  ||            Memory Clear	   ||      Resets the Memory Value back to 0.

MR	  ||             Memory Recall	 ||        Inserts the Memory Value into the current calculation/display.

M+	  ||            Memory Add	     ||      Calculates the result of the current expression on the display and adds it to the Memory Value.

M-	  ||            Memory Subtract	 ||     Calculates the result of the current expression on the display and subtracts it from the Memory Value.


4. Example Workflow for Memory:

* Calculate: 10+5 then press =. (Result is 15).
* Press M+.
* The Memory Value is now 15. (The 'M' indicator appears).
* Calculate: 3√ó4 then press =. (Result is 12).
* Press M+.
* The Memory Value is now 15+12=27.
* Clear the display with C.
* Start a new calculation: 100‚àí
* Press MR. (The expression becomes 100‚àí27).
* Press =. (Final Result is 73).
